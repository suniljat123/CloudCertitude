                  <p>
                    We are proud to report that women in our company represent
                    35.8% of our overall workforce and hold 17% of leadership
                    positions, reflecting our commitment to gender equality.

                  <p>
                    Our leadership team is diverse not only in gender but also in
                    religious and cultural backgrounds, ensuring varied viewpoints
                    in strategic decision-making.

                  <p>
                    We have revamped our recruiting process by introducing blind
                    recruitment process to eliminate unconscious bias during the
                    hiring stage. This ensures that candidates are evaluated based
                    on their skills and qualifications alone.
                  </p>
              
              <h2 class="header2Blog">Inclusive Policies and Benefits</h2>
             
                  <p>
                    Cloud Certitude offers flexible working arrangements and
                    generous parental leave policies to support work-life balance
                    for all employees, regardless of gender.

                  <p>
                      Maintaining our commitment to diversity and inclusivity requires ongoing effort and vigilance.
                       Here are some of the key steps we take to ensure these values remain integral to our company culture:

                      <p>
                          We conduct mandatory training sessions for all employees, with a focus on recognizing and addressing unconscious bias,
                           fostering inclusive leadership, and understanding the importance of diversity in the workplace.

                      <p>
                          We actively seek feedback from our employees through regular surveys, focus groups, and open forums. This feedback is crucial
                           for identifying areas of improvement and implementing effective strategies to address any concerns.
